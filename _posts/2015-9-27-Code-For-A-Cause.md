title: Code For A Cause.  
---

This week in software engineering, Alex Menzies spoke to us about his daily experiences working for an awesomely innovative company like Jet Propulsion Labs in California. It was clear that he is incredibly fulfilled by his contributions to the technology and research, and his advice was very important. It made me reflect on my own summer internship experience and realize how critical is to me to ‘make your limited number of commits count’.

Last week, I received a fantastic full-time offer from the company I interned with this summer in Austin. It has long been in my plans to move back to Dallas with my girlfriend to start our lives, as the jobs in Dallas are more suitable for her profession, and that is where our families live. As a software developer who could find a job basically anywhere, I figured I could just find a job where I’d be happy enough, and try it out for a few years and move on. However, these plans are quickly changing after being offered a job by a company whose mission I felt aligned with.

This company is making healthcare work the way it should. Through client visits, I could see how our work was improving work for physicians, and improving the lives of many chronically ill patients who fumble their way through our outdated health system. I had never felt so motivated to develop great code than for a purpose like this, and my girlfriend saw how happy I was too. 

In conclusion, Alex was right. We really do only have a limited number of commits in our lives and should prioritize fulfillment as we are searching for jobs. Whether you’re ‘walking’ on Mars or improving healthcare for millions of people, we have a very powerful profession to improve our own quality of life as well as others.

####Tip o’ the week
In case you missed it, don’t be like [Volkswagen](http://www.wired.com/2015/09/vw-emissions-deception-11-million-cars/), y’all. Code only has as much integrity as the people who write it.
