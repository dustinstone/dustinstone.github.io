title: IDB Project First Steps
---

This week in Software Engineering, we started working with our teams to complete the first phase of our IDB projects. My initial reaction to the project is that I will gain a tremendous amount of experience from building our project from scratch. Though I've jumped into complex web applications, frameworks, and teams before, I believe it has already been valuable to experience hosting, configuring, and deploying a project with other developers from square one. Additionally, the project utilizes tools and frameworks which some of us have not yet experienced. However, they are similar to things which I've been exposed to in the past. So far, so good. 

Working as a group always has its challenges, but I am confident that we have a cohesive team. Each one of us brings a different set of skills, and our schedules have been consistent enough to hit the ground running. The amount of work which still has to be done is a little overwhelming, but I am certain that we're creating a product which will impress recruiters and look great in our portfolios. To future students, I would advise to put your heart into it, not cut any corners, and get started early! 

####Tip o' the week
Familiarize yourself with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/components/) components and css before you dive into this project. I've lost count of how many times I've tried to build the mechanics of some html-css wizardry, only to realize that it's already available to you. It's pretty frustrating, so learn from me.
