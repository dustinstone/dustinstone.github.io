title: A Case For Testing.  
---

This summer, I worked on a team that did not stress the importance of unit testing or regression testing. My supervisor frequently attributed the lackadaisical attitude to being consistently behind in our software development life cycle and having a ~~safety net~~ quality assurance team in India. He frequently explained to me that I will encounter companies throughout my career which are proponents of either writing tests before or after writing code - the latter of which to save time up-front. And at first, I believed him. However, by week #5 or #6 of my internship, I started submitting large chunks of code to the development branch and the quantity of bugs I received thereafter was staggering. 

This week in class, Professor Downing made a compelling argument for writing tests before developing large pieces of code and generating even more tests once you are convinced the code is correct. Most of the bugs I was responsible for this summer could have been prevented by a number of testing techniques, and the number of time spent on addressing the bugs was likely longer than the amount of time it would have taken to write tests beforehand. An additional benefit of acceptance tests is that they will catch bugs ~~immediately~~ in the future.

#### Tip o’ the week

Pick a technology or language that you are interested in and concoct projects that will help you learn it. Independent studies outside of university have been hugely beneficial to my knowledge and ability to converse with recruiters at career fairs. Resources like [Lynda](https://lynda.com), [Curious](http://curious.com), [Codeacademy](http://codeacademy.com), [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com), and even [YouTube](http://youtube.com) are great and shouldn’t be overlooked.
