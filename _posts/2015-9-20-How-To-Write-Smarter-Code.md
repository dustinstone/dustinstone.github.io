title: How To Write Smarter Code.  
---

This week in software engineering, Professor Downing showed us at least seven or eight ways to calculate root mean squared error between two lists. Though the methods were simple and similar, the runtime varied widely and demonstrated an extremely important message which I find myself often forgetting: don’t reinvent the wheel!

It is easy to catch myself devising complex algorithms and building chunks of code from scratch. As a developer, I enjoy the practice and believe that I am capable of building an OK implementation. But there are often modules, gems, or libraries out there to accomplish basic tasks. This is important not only because it improves the runtime and/or efficiency of your code, but also gives you more time to build your unique solution.

Professor Downing’s lecture was also an exercise in advanced programming. I will admit to not having much experience in stepping a few steps back from the problem, and optimizing every bit that I can. So far, Professor Downing has stressed the importance of minimizing code’s runtime via various algorithmic tricks, mathematical shortcuts, and caches. I truly hope that being exposed to this mindset will instill good programming techniques in my personal development style.

####Tip o’ the week
Lately, I have been interested in starting an extracurricular project. Last week, I found a ‘directory’ of sorts for open-source projects. This week, I found an awesome directory for public APIs: [apihound](http://apihound.com/apifinder). In my experience, learning how to build a web application around an API is a fun way to learn a language, and great practice for hackathons. Happy coding!
