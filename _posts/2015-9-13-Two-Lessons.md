title: Two Lessons.  
---

This was an insightful week for Software Engineering students. Chris Martin, a guest speaker from Bloomberg and former CS 373 student, walked us through a day in the life of a professional developer, and our first project was due on Thursday.

It’s always refreshing to hear the opinions and daily experiences from professional programmers and project leaders. It’s an important reminder that our careers will likely be part of industries which we may know very little of. Just like Chris had to learn about finance, I also had to learn about the state of healthcare at my internship this summer. I had never given this much consideration, but this was really important and motivating once I began to connect the dots between the code I wrote and how it was affecting real people or industry.

A valuable lesson I learned from completing our first project is that there are many tools in the world to solve the same problems. As a freshman, I remember feeling overwhelmed by the never ending list of things I didn’t know. Three years later, I have learned that there are really just a few pieces of the software development life cycle and software stack, and many different implementations and solutions to address each piece. For example, this summer I used Perforce for version control, an internal tool called Hydra for issue tracking, and Jenkins for continuous integration. Even though I had never really used GitHub’s branching, GitHub’s issue tracking, or Travis CI, learning them was less scary once I could relate it to something that I already knew. 

#### Tip o’ the week
This week I’ve been perusing open source communities and projects that I’m interested in contributing to. I found [Oben HUB](https://www.openhub.net/explore/projects) which is a cool resource for tracking ‘hot’ projects and reading brief descriptions about them. Happy coding!
