title: Thoughts About Python.  
---

This week in Software Engineering, I thought I'd reflect on learning the Python programming language. I've attempted to learn Python in the past, but was unsuccessful. I believe that I wasn't yet mature enough for a powerful language like Python, for the following reasons.

Python is a high level, weakly typed, interpreted  language. When I tried to teach myself Python freshman year, before experiencing Java and C, I don't believe that I understood how things were functioning "under the covers". It felt like I was wielding a magic beyond my comprehension, and that scared me away. Now, I know to expect certain behaviors from data types, data structures, and Python shorthand. After learning everything the hard, lower-level, way, I really appreciate and enjoy programming in Python.

On Wednesday and Friday, Professor Downing showed us the utility of iterables, generators, and yield. While iterables and iterators aren't unique to Python, you can accomplish some really cool things with the "lazy" generator and yield combo. In class, we implemented an iterable and iterator, which I believe deepened our appreciation for some of the under the covers work that Python does for you, like the "for in" pattern. Additionally, I believe it also deepened my understanding of the language, so that I might explain potentially unexpected results from writing silly iterable-related code in the future.

####Tip o' the week
I'm a huge advocate for having hobbies. I believe that hobbies relieve stress, and let your mind relax between school and work. They can also bring ideas to your CS work when you least expect it, like interdisciplinary stuff. If you have one, or need one, I recommend searching YouTube for videos about it. I'm also a very big fan of YouTube, and a very curious person in general, so here's a list of my favorite educational and hobbyist channels:
